### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm that one penguin.

I do a lot of stuff, like music, gaming, and technology. Here, though, I focus on coding.

Here's some other stuff you can learn about me!
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on [@DefinityBrowser](https://github.com/DefinityBrowser)!
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to learn C, Java, and Swift!
- ðŸ˜„ I go by `he/him`, `she/her`, and `they/them`!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that I am attempting to own every edition of *Minecraft* possible? [Here's a list of every single one I own.](https://github.com/jbmagination/jbmagination/blob/master/MINECRAFT.md)
