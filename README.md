### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm that one penguin. Particularly, the one you don't know about!**

normally, i talk like this, but considering this is a website where i do a lot of coding stuff, i might as well be a bit more professional.

I do a lot of stuff, like music, gaming, and technology. Here, though, I focus on coding.

Here's some other stuff you can learn about me!
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on... a lot of things, actually, and I'm not really bothered to list it.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to learn Java, however I'm also trying to learn C and Swift!
- ðŸ˜„ I go by `he/him/his`!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that I am attempting to own every edition of *Minecraft* possible? Here's a list of every single one I own. (soonTM)

Anyways, how's your day going? I'm still working on this README, so if you're seeing this line of text check back in a few days!
