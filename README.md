### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm that one penguin.

I do a lot of stuff, like music, gaming, and technology. Here, though, I focus on coding.

Here's some other stuff you can learn about me!
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working with [Definity](https://github.com/DefinityTeam)!
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to learn C, Java, and Swift!
- ðŸ˜„ I go by `he/him`, `she/her`, and `they/them`!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that I am attempting to own every edition, app, game, etc. of *Minecraft* possible? [Here's a list of every single thing of Minecraft I own.](https://github.com/jbmagination/jbmagination/blob/master/info/MINECRAFT.md)
- âš¡ I'm also getting increasingly obsessed with *Genshin Impact*. [Here's some nifty facts about it, my AR and UID, etc.!](https://github.com/jbmagination/jbmagination/blob/master/info/GENSHIN.md)

Something will be here soon...
