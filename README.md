### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm that one penguin.

I do a lot of stuff, like music, gaming, and technology. Here, though, I focus on coding.

Here's some other stuff you can learn about me!
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on... a lot of things, actually, and I'm not really bothered to list it.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently trying to learn Java, however I'm also trying to learn C and Swift!
- ðŸ˜„ I go by `he/him/his` and `they/them/theirs`!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that I am attempting to own every edition of *Minecraft* possible? [Here's a list of every single one I own.](https://github.com/jbmagination/jbmagination/blob/master/MINECRAFT.md)
