*I regularly play on the America server.* I do sometimes play on the Asia server, though.

Also, Genshin has a mainland China version, called [原神](https://ys.mihoyo.com/)! I don't live in China (so it is a million times harder to get), but I am almost pulling all the strings neccessary to play it. Once I have my hands on it, I will definitely be streaming it over on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/jbmagination) when the time comes!
