## Paid games/apps I own

   - Mojang considers this Legacy Console Edition, but I disagree (as does the Minecraft wiki) because it's not made by 4J Studios
- Minecraft: PlayStation®3 Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft: PlayStation®Vita Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
   - This was obtained via Sony's "Cross-Buy" initiative because I own "Minecraft: PlayStation®3 Edition"
   - Unfortunately, however, I do *not* own a PlayStation Vita  
- Minecraft Story Mode - A Telltale Games Series (also referred to as Minecraft Story Mode Season 1)

   - No, I don't live in China

## Games/apps I cannot own *or* legally obtain
- MinecraftEdu (pre-Education Edition)
   - MinecraftEdu licenses were taken down when Education Edition launched ([read](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002851/https://minecraftedu.com/education_edition))
   - TeacherGaming was shutdown in May 2021 ([read](https://web.archive.org/web/20210514223402/https://store.teachergaming.com/))
- Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two
   - The original Telltale Games went out of business, requiring them to shutdown Story Mode services ([read](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-minecraft--story-mode-information))
   - Unfortunately for me, I could not buy Season Two before they went out of business
- Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
   - This Legacy Console Edition version was never released physically
   - As with other Legacy Console editions, the Bedrock edition caused the Console edition to be delisted
   - eShop codes for delisted games cannot be redeemed, as such this game is unobtainable to me
     - I can, however, play through a friend's Nintendo account
 - Minecraft: Apple TV Edition
 - Minecraft: Gear VR Edition
 - Minecraft: Pocket Edition Demo
   - Available to download as part of [a larger archive](https://archive.org/details/MCPEAlpha), but my Google account did not own this app before removal
- Minecraft Reality
   - The app was delisted from the App Store at some point, I don't know when
   - I let [Omniarchive](https://omniarchive.org) know about the app, and we found some IPA files online but are still missing a few versions
   - If *you* have this app on your account, please let us know!

## Games/apps that I am in the process of acquiring

## Games/apps that I plan to get in the future
- Minecraft Legends
- Minecraft 我的世界教育版 (translates as Minecraft My World Education Edition)
   - This version of the game is *not* owned by NetEase! It's owned by JD.com ([read](https://www.jdcloud.com/cn/news/detail/648) + [translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=https://www.jdcloud.com/cn/news/detail/648)) 
   - As far as I'm aware, this merely requires a JD Cloud account... except that requires a mainland China non-VoIP phone number
   - Thankfully, there are multiple services that offer these sorts of numbers, but it will take me some time to get that number, and as such, this version with it
- Minecraft: PlayStation®4 Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft: Xbox One Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft Dungeons Arcade
   - I *might* be crazy. Just a little bit
