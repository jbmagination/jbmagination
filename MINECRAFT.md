   - [RIP. o7](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-earth-coming-end)
- Minecraft 我的世界 (also referred to as Minecraft China*, translates as Minecraft My World)
   - Yes, the game is an official port to China, created thanks to NetEase ([read](https://web.archive.org/web/20190323172244/https://mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-is-coming-to-china/))
   - No, I don't live in China

## Games I cannot legally access, or can't access yet
- MinecraftEdu (pre-Education Edition)
   - MinecraftEdu licenses were taken down when Education Edition launched ([read](https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002851/https://minecraftedu.com/education_edition))
   - TeacherGaming was shutdown in May 2021 ([read](https://web.archive.org/web/20210514223402/https://store.teachergaming.com/))
- Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two
   - The original Telltale Games went out of business, requiring them to shutdown Story Mode services ([read](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-minecraft--story-mode-information))
   - Unfortunately for me, I could not buy Season Two before they went out of business
- Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
   - This Legacy Console Edition version was never released physically
   - As with other Legacy Console editions, the Bedrock edition caused the Console edition to be delisted
   - eShop codes for delisted games cannot be redeemed, as such this game is inaccessible to me
 - Minecraft: Apple TV Edition
 - Minecraft: Gear VR Edition
 - Minecraft: Pocket Edition Demo
   - Available to download as part of [a larger archive](https://archive.org/details/MCPEAlpha), but my Google account does not own this app
- Minecraft Reality
   - The app was delisted from the App Store at some point, I don't know when
   - I've yet to see anyone who actually owns Minecraft Reality, nor do I have a device that supports it
   - If you do have this app, please let me know! Let's work together to archive it

## Games that I am in the process of acquiring
- Minecraft 我的世界: 教育版 (translates as Minecraft My World: Education Edition)
   - This version of the game is *not* owned by NetEase! It's owned by JD.com ([read](https://www.jdcloud.com/cn/news/detail/648) + [translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=https://www.jdcloud.com/cn/news/detail/648)) 
   - As far as I'm aware, this merely requires a JD Cloud account... except that requires a mainland China non-VoIP phone number
   - Thankfully, there are multiple services that offer these sorts of numbers, but it will take me some time to get that number, and as such, this version with it

## Games that I plan to get in the future
-  Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition
   - This version is relatively easy to get, but I'm holding off on it because it's $20 but has very little features
- Minecraft: PlayStation®4 Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft: PlayStation®Vita Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
- Minecraft: Xbox One Edition (Legacy Console Edition)
